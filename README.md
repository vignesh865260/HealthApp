# HealthApp
Health App is a  ML & Data Science based web application used to predict disease on the inputs provided by the doctors.
We covered this disease prediction models.
### Disease Models.
1. Heart Disease.
2. Kidney Disease.
3. Diabetes Disease.
4. Liver Disease.
5. Breast cancer Disease.

### Model Building Approach.
We followed OSEMN - Data science Life Cycle Approach to build our prediction models.
The OSEMN framework: It is one of the popular and common models used to create data science projects.

Kaggle is known for one of the best platform to explore and learning more into the field of Data Science where large amount of data sets are available. One can learn and solve real world problems using such data sets.

# Now how to Create or Build models??🤔🤔🤔

**Scikit-learn (Sklearn)** is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python.

**Colaboratory, or “Colab”** for short, is a product from Google Research. Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser, and is especially well suited to machine learning, data analysis and education

**The Jupyter Notebook** is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. Its uses include data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.

# What about Front End Tools..?🤔🤔
># FLASK - Python  Micro-web-framework

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. ... Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools.
